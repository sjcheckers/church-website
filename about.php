    <p style="color:#333; max-width:900px; margin:auto; font-size:1.1rem; text-align:center;">
      Welcome to Christ Is Love Deliverance Church! We are delighted to have you visit our online home. 
      Our vision is simple yet profound: making the love of Christ known to people. Our mission is to show and communicate 
      the perfect love of God to communities, touching lives with hope, compassion, and grace.
    </p>

    <p style="color:#333; max-width:900px; margin:auto; font-size:1.1rem; text-align:center; margin-top:20px;">
      We believe that love is the foundation of everything we do, guided by 1 John 4:8: 
      <em>"He who does not love does not know God, for God is love."</em> Here, we are reminded that knowing God 
      is inseparable from experiencing and expressing His love.
    </p>

    <p style="color:#333; max-width:900px; margin:auto; font-size:1.1rem; text-align:center; margin-top:20px;">
      Whether you are seeking spiritual growth, encouragement, or a community that reflects God’s heart, you are welcome here. 
      Our prayer is that as you journey with us—through worship, teaching, fellowship, and service—you will encounter the 
      transforming power of God’s love.
